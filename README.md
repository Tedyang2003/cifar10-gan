# cifar10-gan
This project uses a dcgan model to generate similar picturaes to those found in cifar10

Overall the projects main goal is to experiement on developing different GAN architectures centered around DCGANS. Things like upsampling and the introduction of conditions were introduced to the GANs to enhance and or alter their performance

The repository contains 2 folders containing sample images generated by the GAN model. Overall the results are not extremely satisfactory partly due to how the pictures found in the cifar10 dataset themselves were of low resolution.
